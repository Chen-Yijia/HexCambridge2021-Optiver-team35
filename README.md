The codes for HexCambridge 2021: Optiver Challenge

## Files Available
- **"manual.ipynb"**: the jupyter notebook file containing the original codes and some of the test codes we implemented.
- **"BotV1.py"**: We use the money ladder to increase liquidity in both markets, taking a short on the overvalued stock and a long on the under valued stock. 
- **"BotV2.py"**: Using the therotical midvalue, we used a theoratical approach to buy/sell in the less liquid market using a money ladder, followed by hedging on the more liquid market.
- **"BotV3.py"**: We attempted to directly realise profits by purchasing from the liquid market and selling to the illiquid market when market conditions showed that the best bid price for the liquid market is lower than the best ask price of the illiquid market.

## Instructions
- Open either "BotV1.py"/"BotV2.py"/"BotV3.py" file;
- Run the file either in terminal or IDE;
- See the printed out results to monitor the running process.
